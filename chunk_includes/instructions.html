  <p>
    We’re interested in understanding how people describe sets of objects. To find this out, we’re doing a small experiment, in which we’ll show you a number of situations in which some objects are displayed on a screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’d like you to describe each situation in one or more <b>grammatically correct English sentences</b>. The experiment should take you little over 10 minutes.
  </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Based on your descriptions, a reader will try to “reconstruct” the situation. We use the word “reconstruct” loosely here, because <b> the only thing that matters is the different types of objects that the sheet contains</b>. Therefore, please do <b> not </b> say <i>where</i> in the grid a particular object is located (e.g., ”top left”, “in the middle”, “on the diagonal”);</li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Each object is a circle or a square, and either red or blue. Your reader knows this; </li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Please do <b>not “enumerate” </b>the different types of objects. For example, do not say “There is a red circle, two blue circles, and ...”;</li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Every situation contains nine objects. Your reader knows this in advance, and he/she will take this information into account when interpreting your description;</li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Please describe each situation separately, without referring to other situations.</li>
  </ol>

<p>
   During the experiment, you cannot go back to the previous page. You can, however, have another look at the instructions by hovering over the text that says <i>instructions</i>.
