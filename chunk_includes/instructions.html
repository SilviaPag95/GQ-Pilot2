    We’re interested in understanding how people describe sets of objects. To find this out, we’re doing a small experiment, in which we’ll show you a number of situations in which some objects are displayed on a screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’d like you to describe each situation in one or more <b>grammatically correct English sentences</b>. The experiment should take you little over 10 minutes. </p>
 <p>Please try to enter your answer quickly, without giving each problem too much thought. The experiment is not about “getting it right”, but about showing us what are naturalistic ways of describing the situations you encounter.
  </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Based on your descriptions, a reader will try to “reconstruct” the situation. We use the word “reconstruct” loosely here, because <b> the only thing that matters is the different types of objects (i.e. squares, circles, blue, red) that the sheet contains</b>. The placement of the objects is randomly generated every time. Therefore, please do <b> not </b> say <i>where</i> in the grid a particular object is located (e.g., ”top left”, “in the middle”, “on the diagonal”);</li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Your reader knows that each object could be a circle or a square, and could be either red or blue. </li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Please do <b>not “enumerate” </b>the different types of objects. For example, do not say “There is a red circle, two blue circles, and ...”;</li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Every situation contains nine objects. Your reader knows this in advance, and he/she will take this information into account when interpreting your description;</li>
      <p></p>
    <li>Please describe each situation separately, without referring to other situations.</li>
  </ol>

   During the experiment, you cannot go back to the previous page. You can, however, have another look at the instructions by clicking on the button that says <i>Show instructions</i> at any time.

 <p>
 You'll be presented with a training item before starting the experiment.
