Of the circles on the left%2C one is positioned higher than the square%2C and one is lower. The higher circle is placed more to the left than the lower one. The circle on the right is higher than the highest circle on the left.%0AFurther to the right from the rightmost circle%2C there is a red square at some distance to its top and right%2C and another red square to its bottom right. There is a blue circle vertically in between the two red squares%2C but shifted to the right.

The third circle is some distance to the right of the second%2C and is the lowermost object.%0A%0AThe remaining four red circles are horizontally between the blue squares. They are all positioned lower than the second blue square. The leftmost circle of this group is the lowest%2C and the second is at some distance to its top and a small distance to its right. The third is at a small distance to its top-right. The final and rightmost circle is vertically between the first and second circles of this group%2C only slightly to the left of the second blue square.
